## What's this Repository about?

This project is a starting point for my Flutter Application.

The repository for an application project that I've developed as part of the Dicoding Flutter Intermediate class submission plays a crucial role in organizing and managing the data flow within the application. As I delve into the intricacies of building a feature-rich Flutter app, the repository serves as a central hub that connects the various data sources and the rest of the application components seamlessly.

In this project, the repository serves as a mediator, shielding the application from the complexities of data retrieval and manipulation. It abstracts away the implementation details of data sources, such as remote APIs, local databases, or shared preferences, enabling a more modular and maintainable codebase.
